# CVE-2018-9995 - DVR Authentication Bypass

This repository addresses the security vulnerability identified as CVE-2018-9995, affecting various DVR devices, including TBK DVR4104, DVR4216, Novo, CeNova, QSee, Pulnix, XVR 5 in 1, Securus, Night OWL, DVR Login, HVR Login, and MDVR Login. These devices are re-branded versions of the original TBK DVR4104 and DVR4216 series. This vulnerability allows remote attackers to bypass authentication, posing a significant security risk.

# Vulnerability Details

The vulnerability stems from an authentication bypass mechanism, wherein a remote attacker can exploit a "Cookie: uid=admin" header. This header manipulation enables unauthorized access to the device's functionalities. A concrete example of this vulnerability can be observed in the "device.rsp?opt=user&cmd=list" request. The response to this request includes JSON data that inadvertently exposes sensitive credentials.

# Exploitation

Attackers can leverage the "Cookie: uid=admin" header to gain unauthorized access to the affected devices. By issuing a crafted request, such as "device.rsp?opt=user&cmd=list," attackers can retrieve critical information contained within the JSON response, effectively bypassing the authentication process.

# Proof of Concept (PoC)

Included within this repository is a proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability. The PoC illustrates the steps to reproduce the authentication bypass using the identified exploit. It serves as a clear demonstration of the security concern and underscores the urgency of addressing this issue.

# Mitigation

To mitigate the risk posed by CVE-2018-9995, it is recommended to apply the necessary security patches provided by the device manufacturers. Additionally, users should consider implementing network security measures, such as access control lists and firewalls, to restrict unauthorized access to vulnerable devices.
